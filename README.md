# Overview of the statistical analysis: The purpose of the analysis is well defined. (5 pt)
In an effort to create a business model for a shared, public bike rider service – “DM BIKESHARE” – in hometown Des Moines, IA, we analyze how citibike operates within NYC, and then will create a business proposal for setting up in Des Moines. The visualizations that we include in this will show rider demographics and other pertinent rider data to help support our idea for DM BIKESHARE.
## Results: There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt); There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)
This viz shows the checkout times for users within a three-hour timeframe. You can see from the viz that the vast majority of rider trips last10-15 min in length.

This viz shows similar data to the above, only broken down by gender.

The below viz shows trips by weekday. From this viz we can see that the majority of trips taken during the weekday are between the hours of 7AM-10AM and 5PM-8PM. Weekends show a consistent use between 11AM-6PM.

### Summary: There is a high-level summary of the results, and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)
Summary data can be categorized into three separate categories, along with their individual conclusions:
1.	Gender Data. Male riders predominantly are the main users, as displayed consistently across all of the visualized data.
2.	Trip Data/. 
a.	"AVG Trip Duration" shows that there is a gradual upward trend of longer trip duration the younger people are. 
b.	"Trips by Weekday" shows hourly (rows) activity for each day of the week (columns), with darker colors showing more activity. The peak hours seem to be 7:00-9:00 AM and 4:00-7:00 PM Mon-Fri, and afternoons on the weekend. 
c.	"Top Starting Locations" displays a map of Manhattan Island with the most popular starting locations being larger and darker circles.
3.	General Data. General Citibike User Data in terms of Checkout Times, AVG Rider Age, Bike Utilization, and Bike Repair data.
